# Placement_trends_2013-2021
India's state-by-state placement analysis in higher education.
## Project Background
The placement scenario in India has witnessed significant changes over the last decade. Understanding the trends in student enrollment, graduation, and placement in various states can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of India's higher education system and its alignment with the job market.

**This project aims to analyze the state-by-state placement trends in Engineering, Pharmacy, and Management programs from 2013 to 2021, focusing on government and private institutions, gender-based enrollment patterns, and the correlation between student enrollment, graduation, and placement rates.**

## Workflow
- Data Collection : From data.gov.in
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Transformation in Power Query.
- Data Modelling and creating calculated columns.
- Trend Analysis:
   - Gender-based Analysis
   - Regional Comparisons
- Insight Generation and Interpretation: Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data that provide insights into the placement scenario across different states.
- Visualizations: Create informative visualization.
- Presentation: Create a presentation summarizing the project findings for stakeholders, including educational institutions, policymakers, and industry representatives.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key findings:

*17m  Enrollment, 116k Institutes, 7m Placements, and 7m faculties.*

**1. State-by-State Placement Trends:**

  - Top-performing states: States like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh showed consistently higher placement rates, likely due to the presence of a large number of industrial hubs and higher education institutions with strong industry ties.
  - Underperforming states: States like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Himachal Pradesh demonstrated lower placement rates, often due to factors such as a lack of local industry presence, limited government funding, and fewer private institutional options.

**2. Trends Over Time:**

- From 2013 to 2019, placement rates saw a steady improvement, driven by expanding industry ties, government initiatives like Skill India, and improved teaching quality in private institutions.

- 2020-2021 showed a decline in placements due to the pandemic, but IT and Pharma sectors recovered more quickly compared to other sectors like management.
**3. Gender-Based Enrollment and Placement:**

  - Boys vs. Girls Enrollment: Male students outnumbered female students in Engineering and Management programs, but the gender gap was less pronounced in Pharmacy courses.

**4. Institution Type:**

  -  Government Institutions: Placement rates in government institutions were generally lower compared to private institutions, which could be attributed to a variety of factors including outdated curricula, lack of industry collaboration, and resource constraints.
  - Private Institutions: Private institutions generally had better placement outcomes, possibly due to their stronger connections with the industry, more modern curricula, and a focus on employability.
**5. Impact of Regional and Economic Factors:**


- States with a higher concentration of IT and manufacturing industries (e.g., Karnataka, Telangana) generally had better placement outcomes, especially in Engineering.
- The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on placements in 2020 and 2021, with a noticeable dip in overall placements, especially in non-tech sectors like management and pharmacy.
